Telco Customer Churn Prediction
Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge in the telecom industry, where retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

This project applies machine learning models to predict whether a customer will churn based on their demographic, account, and service details. By identifying churn-prone customers, telecom companies can take proactive measures to improve retention.
